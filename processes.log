You can send commands to top with keystrokes. These are some of the most important commands:
Spacebar
Updates the display immediately.
M
Sorts by current resident memory usage.
T
Sorts by total (cumulative) CPU usage.
P
Sorts by current CPU usage (the default).
u
Displays only one user’s processes.
f
Selects different statistics to display.
?
Displays a usage summary for all top commands.

lsof

lsof /usr

 lsof -p 1
  strace touch 1.txt
  strace -o crummyd_strace -ff crummyd
ltrace

#check all multithreaded apps  
ps m
ps m -o pid,tid,command
top -p processID
/usr/bin/time ls
ps -l
renice 20 pid
uptime
/proc/meminfo
 /usr/bin/time cal > /dev/null
 If you’d rather see the page faults of processes as they’re running, use top or ps. When running top, use f to change the displayed fields and u to display the number of major page faults. (The results will show up in a new, nFLT column. You won’t see the minor page faults.)
  ps -o pid,min_flt,maj_flt 20365

  vmstat 2
  iostat -p ALL
  iotop
  ionice
   pidstat -p 1329 1
   cat /etc/security/limits.conf
