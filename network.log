To manually set the IP address and netmask for a kernel network interface, you’d do this:
 # ifconfig interface address netmask mask
 Here, interface is the name of the interface, such as eth0. When the interface was up, you’d be ready to add routes, which was typically just a matter of setting the default gateway, like this:
 # route add default gw gw-address
 route del -net default
 route add -net 192.168.45.0/24 gw 10.23.2.44
 route del -net 192.168.45.0/24
